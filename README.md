Challenge # 02 UT Bootcamp Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

I was able to build my personal portfolio using a index.html file and a .css file. 

I was not certain if I was supposed to try to exactly duplicte the example below:

Although my page design does not match the example given I feel that I was able to demonstrate the concepts in this challenge well. I tried to not get buried in the weeds with how it looked but tried to concentrate on funtionallity.
